			<p>The primary aesthetic concept of Japanese culture is the pursuit of harmony. The vision of the world takes place through nature and concerns the beauty of simplicity. The world presents itself as a flow to our senses, the only reality made of continuous changes. The twin ideals of the cultivation of simplicity and the celebration of what is ancient suggest the transient and evanescent nature of life. Japanese aesthetics is expressed through a delicacy in the forms, a way of conceiving art characterized by modesty and mastery. Far from the wester beauty of grandiose ostentation, the traditional Nipponese aesthetic gives rise to an almost melancholic, thoughtful feeling. Unlike our vision that recognizes aesthetic pleasure regardless of the values it conveys, whether positive or negative, as prevalent in the experience of beauty, in Eastern culture it is closely linked to morality, truth and justice. The achievement of beauty is always accompanied by a search for authenticity. It is in fact rooted the notion that the discovery and nourishment of the self is not purely artistic but, above all, spiritual. The delicate concepts of Mono No Aware and Wabi Sabi celebrate imperfection and signs of aging. Time is considered as an unstoppable flow that in its stream brings unexpected wonders. If one accepts its transience, the signs that time leaves on matter become an added value, they are synonymous with authenticity.
